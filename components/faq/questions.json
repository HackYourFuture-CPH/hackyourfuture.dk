    "question": "How does the selection process work?",
    "answer": "In order to select the best candidates, we ask all applicants to complete a test assignment. No previous knowledge of coding is required, but you need to be able to use the internet reasonably well. The test requires about 30-40hrs of work and you will have 10 days to complete it. After that, we will invite the 30 top candidates for a phone interview and finally select the 15 final students who will join our program. We consider the results of your test assignment, analytical skills, your motivation to learn and determination to start a career as a developer."
